abstract: As the current trend of artificial intelligence is shifting towards self-supervised learning, conventional norms such as highly curated domain-specific data, application-specific learning models, extrinsic reward based learning policies etc. might not provide with the suitable ground for such developments. In this paper, we introduce SEDRo, a Simulated Environment for Developmental Robotics which allows a learning agent to have similar experiences that a human infant goes through from the fetus stage up to 12 months. A series of simulated tests based on developmental psychology will be used to evaluate the progress of a learning model.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This presents our ongoing project for Simulated Environment for Developmental Robotics presented on ICML 2020 workshop (Learning in Artificial Open Worlds).
