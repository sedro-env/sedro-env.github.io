abstract: Task-specific AI agents are showing remarkable performance across different domains. But modeling generalized AI agents like human intelligence will require more than current datasets or only reward-based environments that don't include experiences that an infant gathers throughout its initial stages. In this paper, we present Simulated Environment for Developmental Robotics (SEDRo). It simulates the environments for a baby agent that a human baby experiences throughout the pre-born fetus stage to post-birth 12 months. SEDRo also includes a mother character to provide social interaction with the agent. To evaluate different developmental milestones of the agent, SEDRo incorporates some experiments from developmental psychology.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper was presented at NeurIPS 2020 Workshop on BabyMind,  and discusses about our ongoing project for Simulated Environment for Developmental Robotics .
