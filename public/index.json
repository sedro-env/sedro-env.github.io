Use \u0026ldquo;Clone with SSH\u0026rdquo; option to avoid credential failure issues. You can use GitHub Desktop app to avoid credential failure issues. If you do not have git-lfs enabled, do so to avoid invalid image files.   Clone the Unity ML-agents from here.  Checkout \u0026ldquo;release_3_branch\u0026rdquo;.   Launch unity hub by the command \u0026ldquo;./UnityHub.AppImage\u0026rdquo;.  If you do not have unity hub installed in your machine, follow this link   Using \u0026ldquo;ADD\u0026rdquo; option from the unity hub, navigate to the clonned SEDRo directory and open.  As current version of SEDRo uses Unity Version: 2020.1.2f1, download and install that from the Unity Hub.   While opening the project, an error might be shown mentioning \u0026ldquo;invalid path at ../Packages/manifest.json\u0026rdquo;. Ignore the message and press continue. Once the project is loaded into Unity Editor, got to Window \u0026gt; Package Manager. And remove the existing ML Agents package. Then, follow this link to re-add the ML Agents packeage. This will fix the error mentioned in step 5. Now, inside the Unity Editor, within \u0026ldquo;Scenes\u0026rdquo; folder existing scenes can be opened and interacted with. For example, opening the scene \u0026ldquo;MainScene\u0026rdquo; will look similar to this image-    Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  I do not have unity installed, what can I do?  Please follow this link to install unity in your local machine.   I do not have ML-agents installed, how can I get that?  Clone the Unity ML-agents from here. Then, checkout \u0026ldquo;release_3_branch\u0026rdquo;.   I have clonned the repository, but the .png images seem to be corrupted, what can I do?  To save the time and bandwidth for \u0026ldquo;pushing\u0026rdquo; updates, we have enabled git-lfs for the image files (as they are large in size). You need to have git-lfs enabled to clone the actual image files rather than the placeholder files.   While loading project SEDRo in UnityHub, it is throwing an error about \u0026ldquo;invalid path at ../Packages/manifest.json\u0026rdquo;, what should I do?  This error is occuring due to the local path mismatch of the ML-agents. To solve it, ignore the error message and press continue to load SEDRo. Once the project is loaded into Unity Editor, got to Window \u0026gt; Package Manager. And remove the existing ML Agents package. Then, follow this link to re-add the ML Agents packeage.   I installed the latest version of ML-agents, but still getting namespace error like \u0026ldquo;namespace MLAgents can not be found\u0026rdquo;. How can I solve this?  The current version of SEDRo is implemented with \u0026ldquo;release_3_branch\u0026rdquo; of the ML-agents. Please checkout \u0026ldquo;release_3_branch\u0026rdquo; to resolve the namespace error.
